# Multi-Cycle Processor Project

## Overview
This project implements a multi-cycle processor as a part of the Computer Architecture course. The processor is designed to execute instructions in multiple clock cycles, enhancing its performance compared to a single-cycle processor.

## Features
- **Multi-Cycle Architecture**: The processor is designed to execute instructions in multiple clock cycles, allowing for more efficient operation.
- **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: Defines the supported instructions and their encoding format.
- **Control Unit**: Manages the execution of instructions by controlling the data flow within the processor.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations required by the instructions.
- **Memory**: Includes components for instruction and data memory, enabling instruction fetching and data access.
- **Registers**: Contains the register file for storing intermediate results and data.
- **Clock Cycle Management**: Divides the instruction execution into multiple clock cycles to maximize performance.

## Implementation Details
- **Instruction Execution**: Each instruction is executed in multiple stages, such as instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back.
- **Control Signals**: Various control signals are generated by the control unit to manage the data flow and control the execution of instructions.
- **Pipeline Hazard Handling**: Techniques like forwarding and stalling are implemented to handle hazards such as data hazards and control hazards.
- **Testing and Verification**: Extensive testing is performed using test programs to ensure the correctness and functionality of the processor.

## Usage
1. **Hardware Description Language (Verilog)**: The processor is implemented using a Verilog.
3. **Simulation**: Simulate the processor using a hardware description language simulator (e.g., ModelSim) to verify its functionality.

## Future Improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and implement optimizations to enhance the performance of the processor.
- **Instruction Set Expansion**: Add support for additional instructions to increase the versatility of the processor.
- **Power Efficiency**: Investigate techniques to reduce power consumption without compromising performance.
